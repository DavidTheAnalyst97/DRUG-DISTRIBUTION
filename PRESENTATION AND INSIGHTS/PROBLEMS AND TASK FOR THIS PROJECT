I have been approached by an international organization caled JHG, which is working on sexual reproductive health. 
They have rolled out a program in Kenya, where they are giving HIV preventive medicine freely to anyone in need. 
The pill, which we call *DP*, must be taken daily to be effective 

JHG has partnered with clinics across the country, who will be distributing these DP. 
The DP comes in packages of 30 pills, so once a month a client will need to go back to the clinic and receive a new packages. 
JHG are seeing a much lower uptake and demand for the pills than they had expected. 
They have concluded that it must be a behavioral problem, 
since they have made the pills entirely free and easily accessible in hundreds of clinics across the country.


My task is to:
a) Give an overview of the data. 
Highlight the steps you would take to clean the data, and perform the simple data cleaning on the actual data set.

b) The client wants to better understand continuation rates (how many times the recipient comes back for a refill of the DP), 
*CREATE AN OVERALL VISUAL* of the received DP and refill variables(received DP, month1, month 2, month 3, and month 6). 
These show how long an individual has come back for refills and hence tells you how long they adhered to DP.

-What do you understand from the graph?
-How does the continuation rate vary by county?
